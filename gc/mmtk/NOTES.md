## Weak arrays & ephemerons CRASH under MMTk (high priority, workstream E)

*2026-06-19*

**Confirmed bug, not just a missing feature.** A program that creates weak
arrays / ephemerons and later triggers ephemeron processing (e.g. `Gc.full_major`,
or enough GC activity) **segfaults** under MMTk (MarkSweep and Immix), while it
runs fine on the stock GC. lldb pins the fault in `Ephe_key` (`weak.h:84`)
reading a key field of a garbage ephemeron pointer (`EXC_BAD_ACCESS`).

Root cause: OCaml links every weak array / ephemeron into per-domain lists
`domain->ephe_info->{live,todo}`, walked by the stock major GC (`major_gc.c`).
Our MMTk integration neither scans those lists as roots nor processes them, and
ephemerons/weak arrays are `Abstract_tag` (≥ NO_SCAN) so `scan_ocaml_object`
skips them. So an ephemeron/weak array reachable *only* via `ephe_info` is
treated as dead, collected (or moved) by MMTk, and left dangling in the list —
any later walk (`Gc.full_major`, the next ephemeron pass) dereferences garbage.

This affects a lot of real code: `Weak`, `Ephemeron`, weak hash tables
(`Weak.Make`, `Ephemeron.K1.Make`), memo caches, etc. So it's a priority item.

Fix options:
- *Interim (conservative, stops the crash):* scan `ephe_info->live`/`todo` as
  roots and trace the ephemeron link chain + blocks, keeping weak arrays /
  ephemerons alive and their links updated under moving. Weak refs would then
  never clear (like our finaliser handling keeps finalisable values alive via
  `do_final=1`) — semantically loose but memory-safe.
- *Proper (workstream E):* implement MMTk weak-reference / finalizable
  processing — register ephemerons with MMTk, clear dead keys/data, run
  finalisers — replacing the stock `major_gc.c` ephemeron pass.

Status of other runtime features probed at the same time (MarkSweep + Immix):
`Lazy` works; `Gc.full_major`/`minor`/`stat`/`allocated_bytes` work *in
isolation*; finalisers don't run yet (`do_final=1` keeps values alive); weak
refs read as "still alive" (not cleared). Only the weak/ephemeron-list dangling
above actually crashes.

## Parallel collection — verified (correct, and marking scales ~8x)

*2026-06-19*

MMTk runs collections on multiple GC worker threads (`MMTK_GC_THREADS`, default
from core count). Verified two things on turing (28-core), forcing ~60 GCs over a
~4M-object live set with `MMTK_STRESS_FACTOR`, `setarch -R`, measuring MMTk's own
GC pause time (`mmtk_ocaml_gc_time_ms`):

- **Correctness**: identical results across `MMTK_GC_THREADS` = 1,2,4,8,16 under
  both MarkSweep and Immix. Parallel workers do not corrupt the heap.
- **Scaling depends on live-set shape:**
  - Bushy binary tree (independent subtrees → high marking parallelism):
    GC time 34.4s → 20.1 → 10.5 → 6.3 → 4.1s for 1→2→4→8→16 threads — **~8.4x**
    at 16 threads, near-linear to 4 (then memory-bandwidth-bound).
  - Linked lists (`Array.init 400 (List.init 10000 …)`): flat ~55→65s, no
    speedup (slight regression from coordination/contention). Tracing a list is
    a sequential pointer chase and latency-bound — workload-inherent, **not** a
    binding limitation.

Takeaway: parallel marking engages and scales well for parallel-friendly heaps;
pointer-chasing-heavy heaps are latency-bound regardless of thread count. Both
correct. (Concurrent — as opposed to parallel — collection is a separate,
upstream-dependent matter; see ROADMAP.)

## Pinning under a moving plan — why OCaml's existing rooting mostly suffices

*2026-06-19*

A moving plan (Immix defrag) relocates objects, so any reference into the MMTk
heap must either be a precise, updatable root/slot or the target must be pinned.
The reassuring fact: **OCaml's stock GC already moves objects** (minor-heap
objects are relocated on promotion), so all correctly-written C code already
roots the `value`s it holds across an allocation (via `CAMLparam`/`CAMLlocal`,
which land in `caml_local_roots` and are scanned + updated). MMTk-moving inherits
that safety for free.

The residual risk is narrow: code that holds an **unrooted raw pointer to an
object it assumes won't move** — safe under the stock GC because *major*-heap
(old) objects don't move there, but unsafe under Immix, which can move any
object. Finding such spots is the "tier-2 validation" in the roadmap.

Validation strategy (in lieu of an exhaustive audit): run under
`MMTK_IMMIX_ALWAYS_DEFRAG=true MMTK_IMMIX_DEFRAG_EVERY_BLOCK=true`, which
relocates **every** live object on **every** GC — the harshest possible test for
a stale pointer. So far this passes: the torture, retain (200k-list), infix
(mutually-recursive closures), and multi-domain churn tests all run correctly
under it, and a 150-iteration soak (multidom8 + infix, alternating) was clean.
No explicit pin has been needed yet. The next broadening step is OCaml's own
testsuite under forced defrag (roadmap M7), which exercises far more C
primitives and object shapes.

## MMTk fixed-address metadata mmap can fail with EEXIST (ASLR collision)

*2026-06-19*

Intermittently, a fresh run aborts at startup with:

```
panicked at mmtk-0.32.0/src/policy/space.rs:724: failed to mmap meta memory: File exists (os error 17)
```

On Linux mmtk-core maps its side-metadata with `MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE`
(`util/memory.rs`), which returns `EEXIST` when something ASLR placed lands in
MMTk's fixed metadata range. It is intermittent (depends on ASLR), happens at
init (not during GC), and is unrelated to our binding or the moving code — a
soak hit it roughly once per ~30 fresh processes.

Workaround for testing: run under `setarch -R` (disables ASLR), and/or retry the
process on this specific panic (our soak script does both). It still recurred
once even with ASLR off, so it's not fully eliminated. Proper fix is upstream
(mmtk-core mmap strategy); track there. Not a correctness issue for a successful
run.

## Backup threads vs. MMTk's own GC threads (deferred)

*2026-06-19*

**Context.** OCaml 5's runtime gives every domain a *backup thread*. Its job is
to participate in stop-the-world (STW) sections — `caml_try_run_on_all_domains`
— on behalf of a domain that has released its domain lock, i.e. one sitting in a
C blocking section and not running OCaml. Without it, an OCaml STW would
deadlock waiting for a blocked domain that cannot itself reach the barrier.
(State machine and rationale: `BT_*` in `runtime/domain.c`.)

We currently **rely** on this mechanism. When a domain parks for an MMTk
collection it releases the domain lock and enters `BT_IN_BLOCKING_SECTION`
(`caml_mmtk_park` in `runtime/mmtk.c`), so its backup thread answers any
*concurrent* OCaml STW. This is what fixes the MMTk-STW-vs-OCaml-STW deadlock we
hit with multi-domain programs: a domain terminating (which runs an OCaml STW
via `caml_try_run_on_all_domains`) at the same moment MMTk was stopping the world
would otherwise deadlock — OCaml waits for the parked domains to join its
barrier, MMTk waits for every domain to park. Routing the MMTk park through the
blocking-section/backup-thread path lets the two barriers coexist.

**Open question: can the backup thread be removed entirely once MMTk owns the
GC?** MMTk runs its own dedicated GC worker threads, so the *original* reason
backup threads exist — running GC STW work (major-GC slices) on behalf of blocked
domains — no longer applies under MMTk; MMTk's workers do that work. If MMTk is
the only collector, OCaml's native STW is then needed only for **non-GC**
purposes (domain spawn/terminate, `Gc.compact`/stat, a few runtime maintenance
operations). If those were re-expressed — or themselves driven through MMTk's
stop-the-world — the backup thread, and the whole *dual* STW machinery that
caused the deadlock above, might be eliminable. That would simplify the runtime
and remove a class of races by construction.

**Before acting, check what still needs OCaml STW:**

- Domain lifecycle: `domain_create` / `caml_domain_terminate` use
  `caml_try_run_on_all_domains` to mutate the global domain set.
- `Gc` stat/compact and any `caml_try_run_on_all_domains[_async]` callers that
  survive once the stock major/minor GC is gone.
- Signal handling and anything else that assumes a blocked domain can be
  represented at a STW barrier by its backup thread.

**Status.** Not urgent. Revisit once the GC plan stabilises (post-Immix), when we
can see the full set of remaining `caml_try_run_on_all_domains` callers in a
MMTk-only build and decide whether to (a) keep cooperating with backup threads
as we do now, or (b) drive all remaining STW through MMTk and drop backup
threads. Tracked here; consider promoting to a GitHub issue when we schedule it.
